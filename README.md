# multiplyGrids
rough draft of an app to make multiplication more visible.
It's not as if this is even POSSIBLE because this crap is NOt designed to be understood.
I mean, flogging android studio informs me that everything is already on GitHub.  
I DELETED IT!~!!!
It floggign told me o m g don't do this you can't undo it.
HOWEVER you can't get it back BUT YOU CAN'T EVER REALLY UNDO YOUR ANDROID STUDIO SINS. 

GIVE ME BACK BASIC AND DOS>
